let arrays = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]];

/*

To flatten the arrays array into a single array, we can use the reduce() method in combination with the concat() method, as follows:

javascript
Copy code
let arrays = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]];

let flattenedArray = arrays.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator.concat(currentValue), []);

console.log(flattenedArray);
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
In this code, we use the reduce() method on the arrays array, which iterates over each sub-array in the array, and applies a callback function to each element. The callback function takes two arguments: an accumulator and the currentValue being processed. The accumulator holds the result of the previous iteration.

We start with an empty array as the accumulator and call the concat() method on it with the currentValue. The concat() method returns a new array that contains the elements of both the accumulator and currentValue.

The reduce() method continues to iterate over each sub-array, and concatenates each sub-array to the accumulator, thereby flattening the arrays array into a single array.

Finally, the flattenedArray is printed to the console using console.log().
